        <h2 class="section-title">Hello world, I'm Michelle!</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Michelle Glisson. I have learned that in cybersecurity there are many paths. Big data analytics grabbed my interest, then digital forensics and reverse engineering. Now, after listening to podcasts, I get excited about offensive security.
            <br><br>
            I completed my AAS in Cybersecurity at Century College, where I learned to ask questions and developed a stong curiosity. I am looking to obtain a job in the field so I can continue to grow.

                <h3>What is Cryptography?</h3>
                <h4>We use it every day.</h4>
                <p>I always thought Cryptography was cool, but I didn't think there was any reason to learn more about it because it uses complicated algorithms that are done by computers. I learned that we use it more than we know when using web pages.  Websites use certificates to encrypt data. Symmetric encryption uses a shared single key, and is used for more sensitive data like credit card numbers. Some examples of symmetric encryption are AES, DES/3DES, and BitLocker. Asymmetric encryption is often used because the website can give out its public key to all the users, who have their own private keys. An example of asymmetric encryption is RSA. I generated an SSL certificate for asymmetric cryptography using openSSL in command line. Self-signed certificates are cheaper and easy to implement at any time, but they can't be trusted. A root certificate is given from a trusted Certificate Authority and can be expensive. The history of Cryptography is interesting because in the past it was controlled by the government and was on the munitions list like a weapon.

                <h3>What is Ansible?</h3>
                <h4>We can automate configuration, management, and deployment of remote systems using Ansible. </h4>
                <p>Containers are being used for web servers because they are lightweight. Containers do not have an Operating System and only have the components needed for its intended use. Containers can be shared and downloaded, making it easy for others to use them. This makes distributing code easy. Docker is a free and open-source software for downloading, creating, or installing containers. Deploying a container manually using Docker-compose in the command line can be tedious and there is room for human error. Ansible simplifies the process and eliminates error. I used a YAML file to automate the Docker-compose process with Ansible and deploy multiple containers at once. This is how we can use code to deploy infrastructure (IaC - Infrastructure as Code). Using Ansible and IaC simplifies Continuous Integration (CI) which makes sure new versions can be deployed quickly, and Continuous Deployment (CD) which is deploying the new version automatically to a live system.
